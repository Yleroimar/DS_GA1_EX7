# Distributed Systems: Group Assignment (Task) 1 - Sub-task 7

**Group:** Kert Tali, Oliver Vainum√§e, Kaspar Valk

### To run the program, use the following command:
``` sh
python main.py Input-file.txt
```

### To run unittests, use the following command:
``` sh
python -m unittest tests/test_*
```
Note that tests may fail because of sub-processes or peer servers not getting properly terminated.  
Tests can also be executed directly through **PyCharm** for a nice live UI.
